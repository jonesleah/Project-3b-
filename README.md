### Project
Email Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms
- Spam emails are unsolicited messages that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. Detecting
and filtering these spam emails most effectively is crucial for improving email communication
efficiency and security.


### Tools Used
- Main Language: Python
- Flask web framework for backend API
- Pycharm for data processing and algorithm development
- Jupyter Notebook to visualize the model as we train
- scikit-learn machine learning library for Python
- pandas library for DataFrame use
- NLTK for natural language processing (NLP) of the email dataset
- Basic frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Deploy application on Vercel


### Visuals: User interface

- Access the Vercel deployment here https://project-3b.vercel.app/


### How our code works
Our project is focused on spam detection using machine learning algorithms. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to input email content for spam detection. The backend, developed with Flask, handles API requests and processes the data using Python. The primary algorithm implemented is a Naive Bayes classifier, with plans to compare its performance to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The data for the project is sourced from the Enron email dataset, which has been preprocessed to remove noise and improve accuracy. Our system aims to classify emails as spam or not spam with high precision and efficiency.
