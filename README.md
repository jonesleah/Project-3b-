### Project
Email Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms
- Spam emails are unsolicited messages that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. Detecting
and filtering these spam emails most effectively is crucial for improving email communication
efficiency and security.


### Tools Used
- Main Language: Python
- Flask web framework for backend API
- Pycharm for data processing and algorithm development
- Jupyter Notebook to visualize the model as we train
- scikit-learn machine learning library for Python
- pandas library for DataFrame use
- NLTK for natural language processing (NLP) of the email dataset
- Basic frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Deploy application on Vercel


### Visuals: User interface
